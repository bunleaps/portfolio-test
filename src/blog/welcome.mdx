# Welcome to My First Post!

This is some **MDX content**. You can write Markdown and embed React components directly here.

For example, here's a simple React component:

<MyCustomDiv>
  This is content inside my custom div component!
</MyCustomDiv>

You can also use typical Markdown features like:

* Lists
* Code blocks:
    ```javascript
    console.log('Hello, MDX!');
    ```
* Links: [Google](https://www.google.com)

This blog post demonstrates how to integrate MDX with Next.js App Router.
