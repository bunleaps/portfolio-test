Hello, everyone! Building on the discussions about Target Discovery and Enumeration, I recently had the opportunity to put theory into practice on `pentest.id`, a target specifically hosted by my lecturer for us to explore. This hands-on experience truly solidified my understanding of how crucial these initial phases are in any ethical hacking engagement.

The goal was to identify active machines, understand their network footprint, and discover open ports and running services – essentially, to map out the target's online presence.

#### Initial Reconnaissance with DNS

My first step was to gather basic DNS information for `pentest.id`. Using simple `host` commands, I was able to quickly resolve its IP addresses and other associated records.

Here's a summary of the key DNS records I found for `pentest.id`:

| Record Type | Value |Organization/Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| A | 104.21.0.181, 172.67.128.45 | Cloudflare, Inc. | 
| AAAA | 2606:4700:3036::ac43:802d, 2606:4700:3034::6815:b5 | Cloudflare, Inc. | 
| MX | 10 smtp.pentest.id | PT NettoCyber Indonesia, Handles mail service |
| NS | vera.ns.cloudflare.com, tom.ns.cloudflare.com | Cloudflare manages name servers |
| SOA | dns.cloudflare.com (MNAME) | Cloudflare's SOA record |
| TXT | v=spf1 +mx +a +ip4:120.89.92.81~all, v=DMARC1; p=none; | SPF and DMARC records for email security |

This initial DNS reconnaissance painted a clear picture: 

`pentest.id` is actively hosted, uses Cloudflare for its infrastructure, and has dedicated mail services.

#### Deep Dive with Nmap Port Scanning

With the basic DNS information in hand, I moved on to active scanning using Nmap. This is where we start interacting directly with the target to discover open ports and identify services running on them.

Initial Default Scan 

```bash
nmap pentest.id
```

My first Nmap scan targeted `pentest.id`'s `172.67.128.45` IP address. It revealed several open TCP ports:

This practical exercise on `pentest.id` was incredibly insightful. It demonstrated how even a relatively simple domain can reveal a wealth of information through careful target discovery and enumeration. The extensive use of Cloudflare is prominent, protecting and proxying many of the services. The various open ports indicate a number of accessible services, even if some detailed versions remained elusive. This kind of hands-on reconnaissance is vital for understanding a target's attack surface before moving on to more intrusive phases of a penetration test. Every piece of information, from DNS records to open ports and service headers, builds a more complete picture for a security assessment.
