# 🛡️ Ethical Hacking: Target Scoping and Information Gathering

In any ethical hacking or penetration testing engagement, your success starts before you write a single exploit. It begins with **target scoping** and **information gathering**, two essential phases that define the structure, boundaries, and effectiveness of your entire operation.

---

## 🎯 Target Scoping: Defining the Boundaries

Target scoping is the process of clearly outlining:
- **What you are testing**
- **Why you're testing it**
- **How you'll go about it**
- **What’s off-limits**

This phase ensures both the client and the ethical hacker are legally and operationally aligned.

### 📋 Key Components of Scoping

- **Client Requirements & Business Objectives**  
  Understand what the client wants to protect (e.g., customer data, availability) and what they want to learn.

- **Test Boundaries**  
  Clearly define:
  - IP ranges
  - Websites, apps, APIs
  - Cloud services or third-party systems (in or out?)

- **Penetration Testing Type**
  - Black-box (no prior knowledge)
  - White-box (full access/knowledge)
  - Gray-box (limited access)
  - Social engineering included or excluded
  - DoS testing allowed?

- **Assets and Contacts**
  - Operating Systems in use
  - Devices: servers, firewalls, IDS/IPS
  - Point of contact in case of incident

- **Logistics**
  - Project timeline
  - Budget
  - Reporting requirements

> 📝 **Remember**: A signed *Rules of Engagement* (RoE) document is essential before starting anything.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Information Gathering: Mapping the Target

Once scope is locked down, the next step is **information gathering**, or *footprinting*. This involves collecting as much intel as possible about the target using legal, passive, and active methods.

### 🧭 Types of Information Gathering

#### 💤 Passive Information Gathering

Collect data **without alerting the target**:

- **Company Website Analysis**  
  URLs, email formats, tech stack
- **WHOIS Lookup**  
  Domain registrant info, name servers
- **DNS Enumeration**  
  Using `dig`, `host`, `nslookup`
- **Email Discovery**  
  Search Google Groups, LinkedIn, company pages
- **Social Media & Public Repos**  
  GitHub leaks, tech exposure
- **Competitive Intelligence Tools**
  - `domaintools.com`
  - `alexa.com`
  - `archive.org`

#### ⚡ Active Information Gathering

Requires **interacting with the target** systems:

- **Network Scanning**  
  `nmap`, `masscan`, `netcat`
- **Port and Service Discovery**
- **Banner Grabbing & HTTP Methods**  
  Reveals server type, tech, sometimes OS
- **DNS Zone Transfers**  
  Attempt using `dig AXFR` (if misconfigured)
- **Cookies & Web Bugs**
  Analyze how tracking is used, and data stored client-side

---

## 🧪 Practical Footprinting Example

You're tasked with testing `company.com`. You:
1. Perform a **WHOIS lookup**: Discover registrar and tech contact.
2. Use `theHarvester`: Find employee emails and subdomains.
3. Try a **zone transfer** using `dig`:
   ```bash
   dig @ns1.company.com company.com AXFR
   ```
4. Use **Paros Proxy** or **Burp Suite**: Inspect cookies, headers, and request methods.

## 🧠 Key Tools

| Purpose                | Tools |
|------------------------|-------|
| WHOIS & Domain Info    | `whois`, `host`, `dig` |
| Subdomain Enumeration  | `Sublist3r`, `Amass` |
| Web Analysis           | `Paros`, `Burp Suite`, `Wappalyzer` |
| Social Intel           | `LinkedIn`, `Google Dorks`, `hunter.io` |
| People Search          | `pipl.com`, `yoname.com` |
| Reporting              | `Dradis`, `Faraday` |

---

## ⚖️ Ethical Boundaries & Best Practices

- Stick strictly to the **defined scope**
- Do not test or touch unauthorized systems
- Keep logs of all activity
- Inform clients of any **unexpected findings**
- Use reporting tools for documentation

---

## 🔚 Conclusion

Target scoping ensures you're hacking the right things, for the right reasons, within agreed rules. Information gathering builds the foundation for every test you’ll execute afterward. Together, they turn a shot in the dark into a precise, controlled, and valuable penetration test.

> 🧭 **Plan smart. Hack legal. Report responsibly.**
