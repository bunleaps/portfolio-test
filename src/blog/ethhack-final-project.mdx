Hello, everyone! Our latest hands-on learning experience culminated in a comprehensive penetration test, and I'm excited to share the insights from the executive report. The primary objective was clear: to obtain root access on a target server (`server3.pentest.id`) initially hidden behind a Cloudflare proxy. This assessment aimed to enumerate services, identify vulnerabilities in the WordPress installation or exposed ports, and then leverage these to escalate privileges to full root control.

This exercise provided a full lifecycle view of a penetration test, from initial bypasses to ultimate system compromise.

### Methodology: Our Approach to the Target

Our strategy was methodical, moving from external reconnaissance to deep system access:

1.  **Bypass Cloudflare:** The first hurdle was bypassing the Cloudflare proxy to identify the origin IP address behind `server3.pentest.id`. We successfully used tools like Censys to locate the direct IP: `http://103.196.152.184`. This crucial step allowed us to directly interact with the server, bypassing Cloudflare's protective layer.

2.  **Enumeration:** With the origin IP in hand, we proceeded with detailed enumeration:
    * **Nmap:** Used to scan and reveal open ports and running services on the target server.
    * **WpScan:** Since WordPress was identified, WpScan was employed to check the WordPress version, installed plugins, themes, and users.

3.  **Credential Brute-force:** Based on our enumeration, we identified a potential username (`@admin`). We then used a Python script to generate a custom password list from clues found on the site. This led to a successful login.

### Key Findings: Vulnerabilities Discovered

Our penetration test identified three significant vulnerabilities, each providing a stepping stone towards full system compromise. Here's a summary:

| No. | Vulnerability                                  | Risk Level  | What Affected                                    | Exploit Method                               |
| :-- | :--------------------------------------------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Weak Authentication Mechanism                  | OWASP-R2: Medium | `http://103.196.152.184/wp-login.php`              | Brute-force via clue-based password generation |
| 2   | Authenticated RCE via Plugin/Theme Editor      | OWASP-R3: High   | WordPress Dashboard                              | Reverse shell via PHP code injection         |
| 3   | Privilege Escalation via Suspicious Executable | OWASP-R4: Critical | Linux Server (`/usr/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-object`) | Execute potential privilege escalation file  |

Let's delve into each finding:

#### Finding 1: Weak Authentication Mechanism

* **Risk Level:** OWASP-R2: Medium
* **Affected:** The WordPress login page (`wp-login.php`).
* **Exploit Method:** Brute-force attack using a password list generated from site-specific clues.
* **Impact:** We successfully gained access to the WordPress dashboard using identified credentials.
* **Recommendations:** Implement strong password policies, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and use brute-force protection mechanisms (e.g., login attempt limits, CAPTCHAs).

#### Finding 2: Authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Plugin/Theme Editor

* **Risk Level:** OWASP-R3: High
* **Affected:** The WordPress Dashboard (specifically, the plugin/theme editor functionality).
* **Exploit Method:** After gaining authenticated access, we injected a PHP reverse shell payload into a plugin file via the WordPress theme/plugin editor. This payload was configured to connect back to our Netcat listener.
* **Impact:** We achieved a reverse shell on the server with `www-data` user privileges, gaining full control of the server through the admin interface.
* **Recommendations:** Disable file editing from within the WordPress dashboard (by adding `define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true);` to `wp-config.php`), ensure strong admin passwords, and limit access to the dashboard from trusted IPs.

#### Finding 3: Privilege Escalation via Suspicious Executable

* **Risk Level:** OWASP-R4: Critical
* **Affected:** The Linux Server, specifically a suspicious SUID binary at `/usr/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-object`.
* **Exploit Method:** During post-exploitation enumeration using tools like `linpeas`, we discovered a non-standard SUID binary (`x86_64-linux-gnu-object`) in `/usr/bin/`. Upon execution, this binary called `setuid(0)` and then executed `/bin/bash`, effectively spawning a root shell.
* **Impact:** Full root shell access to the target server.
* **Recommendations:** Regularly audit and remove untrusted or unknown binaries, check `cron` jobs, SUID files, and `PATH` abuse vectors, and rebuild the server from clean backups if root is fully compromised.

### Conclusion

This penetration test on `server3.pentest.id` was an invaluable learning experience. It demonstrated a full attack chain, from initial reconnaissance and bypassing external defenses to leveraging web application vulnerabilities for initial access, and finally, escalating privileges to achieve full root control.

The findings highlight several critical lessons for cybersecurity:
* **Importance of Strong Authentication:** Weak credentials are still a common entry point.
* **Securing Web Applications:** WordPress installations require careful hardening, especially disabling sensitive functionalities like file editors.
* **Vigilance on System Binaries:** Suspicious executables and misconfigurations are often overlooked privilege escalation vectors.
* **Defense in Depth:** Even with Cloudflare in front, vulnerabilities in the origin server's application and configuration can lead to compromise.

This exercise solidified my understanding of the interconnectedness of different vulnerability types and the methodical approach required for a successful penetration test, ultimately leading to actionable recommendations for improving security posture.
